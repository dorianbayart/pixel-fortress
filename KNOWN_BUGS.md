# Known bugs and issues

- [ ] When a building is destroyed, it's sprite is not replaced by grass
- [x] When positioning a building at the bottom of the map, created units are outside of the map, crashing the game  
    -> Fix: Units are now created at the same position as the building.  
    _TODO_: need to position the unit at a better position around the building

- [ ] UI on mobile is not working properly
- [ ] bottom bar UI on mobile needs to be adapted (maybe on 2 rows)
